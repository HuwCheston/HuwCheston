### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Huw, and Iâ€™m a PhD student in Music Information Retrieval at the Centre for Music and Science, University of Cambridge. Iâ€™m interested in what large-scale computer modelling, data analysis, and artificial intelligence can teach us about the ways in which humans create, understand, and engage with music and art. During my PhD, I have undertaken research internships in Spotifyâ€™s Audio Intelligence lab and published articles in Transactions of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval, Music Perception and Royal Society Open Science. I'm also a musician (mostly ðŸŽ¸) and sound recordist.
