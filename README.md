### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Huw, and I'm a data scientist based near London with broad interests across audio and music information retrieval and understanding.

I currently hold two positions within industry and academia. I work part-time on machine learning research and development at Colossal Sound. Separately, I am also a part-time research assistant for Iran Romanâ€™s work into multimodal artificial intelligence at the School of Electronic and Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Music Computing at the Centre for Music and Science, University of Cambridge, supervised by Peter Harrison. During this time, I undertook research internships in Spotifyâ€™s Audio Intelligence lab and published articles in Royal Society Open Science, Transactions of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval, Music Perception. 

I'm also a musician (mostly ðŸŽ¸) and sound recordist.
