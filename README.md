### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m [Huw Cheston](https://huwcheston.github.io/), and Iâ€™m a PhD student at the Centre for Music and Science, University of Cambridge. Iâ€™m interested in what large-scale computer modelling and data analysis can teach us about the ways in which humans create, understand, and engage with music and art ðŸŽ¹ðŸ¤–. Most of my previous work has focussed on improvised music, especially jazz, where I have written on subjects including *performer identification*, *style classification*, and *action coordination*. I'm also a musician (mostly ðŸŽ¸) and sound recordist.
